Before stepping into the deeper analysis on each factor, we did a data preprocessing to reduce some side effects and variables for easier plots. Firstly, we only focused on English games that are played on Windows, since they take the majority of the steam games. What‚Äôs more, we converted `release_date` to `release_year`, as we found that most games released in the same year have similar rating scores, hence greater impact of year compared to dates. Finally, we added a data pivoting table of categories and genres to the dataframe by selecting the main categories and genres (which will be explained later). The the final dataframe for EDA use can be seen in ‚ÄúData Frame Display‚Äù section.
        
Based on the processed dataframe, we first used `seadorn` to inspect kernel density estimation and scatter plots of each factors that we are interested in where we made our inital observations. Then we plotted a heatmap to discover the correlations between factors that are presented in numbers.

Initial observations we made:
    
- Ratings decreases overtime, suggesting that the newer the game is, the lower ratings it has.
- As price increases, ratings increase, suggesting that people are more likely to rate higher if they spend more money on that game.
- Higher ratings will be resulted from more owners, suggesting that games with more owners will gain higher ratings.

Based on the initial correlations we found, we then did a closer check of our assumptions.

#### Conclusions:

- Number of releases does increase overtime with a short drop between 2018 and 2019 which is not significant.
- The mean rating dropped approximately by 10% in total, while there is a dramatic decrease between 2013 and 2014.
- After 2013, under half of games are scored over 75, suggesting that high ratings are less likely to occur overtime.

Generally, older games tend to have higer rating scores, although more games are released recently.

We can see that there is correlation between different genres, which means one game can have several genres. It suggests that the high rating of a game may not depend on single genre or category, but here for simple analysis, we assume that the performance of each genres is independent.

#### Conclusions:

Upon the two plots on the left, they show that

- The more owners of a game, the more times that game is likely to have been rated 
- the rating score will be higher with a larger number of owners
  
This relationship is quite intuitive, as it is expected that better games would gain more popularity and consequently receive more positive ratings. There are also a few exceptions that deviate from the observed trend. 

For the two plots on the right, comparing the price of a game to the number of ratings and the rating score, we could not clearly identify the relationship between price and ratings. It is probably because the rating of a game typically reflects the overall quality, gameplay experience and other factors that contribute to the enjoyment of players. While price can be a factor that affects owners' expectations and initial interest in a game, it does not necessarily determine the actual quality or the rating it receives.

It can be explained as one developer tends to develop many different genres of games, where genres seem to have greater influence on ratings.

A further analysis on the reputation of developers would be mentioned in model prediction section.")
